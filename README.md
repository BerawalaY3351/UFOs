## Summary

### Drawbacks:
There were drawbacks to the work. The filters operate only with exact data input and are sensitive to letter casing. To effectively use the filters, the user must be familiar with the scope of the dataset and ensure proper spelling without any spaces at the end, using the correct letter casing.

### Recommendations:
The user experience would greatly benefit from the addition of a dropdown filter option, allowing for multiple filters to be set such as date ranges. Upgrading the web app to access live data sources for the most recent UFO sightings, and potentially displaying additional information from news sources, would also enhance the experience.
